The script is used to acheive sychornization between multi-SQLbase. 

To achieve this purpose, his script contians varied functions:
Miss and repitition checking, ID detection and searching, ID generation, SQL interaction. 

PS: the none gitbub version is only different to this version in the existence of valid SQL server address. 

PS2: I think this code can looks much more compact if I use more list operation and Pandas and Numpy. But I get way too lazy, which end up with more work and bug to fix during 
the development. May be do not code like me is a good tip
